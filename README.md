## Hi, I'm Nils ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Mathematics in Data Science at TUM, specializing on machine learning on graphs and cloud computing. Currently, I am working on my Masterâ€™s thesis with the [DAML group](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) group, where I focus on applying generative models to hierarchical graphs. Besides my thesis, I am working as a backend developer at [Articly](https://www.articly.de), where we push the limits on AI-based audio products.

As I complete my studies at the end of this year, I am seeking new challenges and opportunities. If youâ€™re interested, please feel free to reach out.
